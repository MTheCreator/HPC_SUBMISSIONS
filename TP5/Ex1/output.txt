--------------------------------------------------------------------------
prterun has exited due to process rank 1 with PID 15637 on node Mounias-MacBook-Pro exiting
improperly. There are three reasons this could occur:

1. this process did not call "init" before exiting, but others in the
job did. This can cause a job to hang indefinitely while it waits for
all processes to call "init". By rule, if one process calls "init",
then ALL processes must call "init" prior to termination.

2. this process called "init", but exited without calling "finalize".
By rule, all processes that call "init" MUST call "finalize" prior to
exiting or it will be considered an "abnormal termination"

3. this process called "MPI_Abort" or "prte_abort" and the mca
parameter prte_create_session_dirs is set to false. In this case, the
run-time cannot detect that the abort call was an abnormal
termination. Hence, the only error message you will receive is this
one.

This may have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by prterun (as reported here).

You can avoid this message by specifying -quiet on the prterun command
line.
